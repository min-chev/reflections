When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-Because you have a second, safer, easily accessble from other computers/people copy of your work.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-You might not want to have the changes in the github repository, e.g. when it's public.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Branches are new project heads, for testing new features and e.g. Clones are repository copies from a computer
to another, or to the same computer in another directory. Forks are copies of a repository on GitHub.
