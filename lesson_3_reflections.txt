When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-Because you have a second, safer, easily accessble from other computers/people copy of your work.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-You might not want to have the changes in the github repository, e.g. when it's public.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Branches are new project heads, for testing new features and e.g. Clones are repository copies from a computer
to another, or to the same computer in another directory. Forks are copies of a repository on GitHub.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-Not needing to deal with merging and merge conflicts.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- It would be harder to keep in touch with other people, send them the repositories and e.t.c. On the other
side you wouldn't need to learn how to use Git and Github.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
-I would make changes in a separate branch if i'm working on a new feature, and in master if i'm upgrading the programm,
and am sure, that the upgrade is working fine.
