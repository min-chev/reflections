When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-Because you have a second, safer, easily accessble from other computers/people copy of your work.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-You might not want to have the changes in the github repository, e.g. when it's public.
